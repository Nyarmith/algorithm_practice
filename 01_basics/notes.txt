i


models of computing
    - all models can represent each other
RAM model
    Real world uses RAM model
    RAM model >= other models because it can implement the others
    faster than others
Pointer Model
Lisp Model


ADT - Abstract Data Type
    not a data structure - defines the interface.
    independent of the implementation
    eg. - Queue - Enqueue(Q, e), Dequeue(Q)
          Stacks - Push(S,e) Pop(S)
          Dicts - Insert(D, key, val) Retrieve(D, key)
          Priority Queue - Insert(Pq, e) Extract-Max(Pq)
          Set - Add(S,e) Remove(S,e) Exists(S,e)
          List - Insert(L, e, index), Get(L, ind) Remove(L, ind)


proving correctness
    loop invariant - prove three statements, proof by induction
        1 - some invariant holds on first execution
        2 - maintenance, if invariant is held on all previous loops, it holds on current pass
        3 - termination, if the invariant holds at the end,


O notation
    big O, little o
    big Omega, little omega
    theta

    O <=
    o <
    Omega >=
    omage >=
    theta, both
